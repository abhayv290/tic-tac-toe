                <li><title>Tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a classic paper-and-pencil game played on a grid of 3x3 squares. The game is usually played by two players who take turns marking spaces on the grid with their respective symbols, usually an "X" and an "O." The goal is to create a line of three of your own symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

                    Here are the basic rules of tic-tac-toe:
                    
                    1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
                    2. Two players take turns marking empty spaces on the grid.
                    3. The first player usually uses "X," and the second player uses "O."
                    4. Players alternate turns until the game ends.
                    5. A player wins if they have three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
                    6. If all spaces on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
                    
                    To play tic-tac-toe, players take turns placing their symbol in an empty square on the grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all the spaces are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
                    
                    Tic-tac-toe is a simple and often quick game to play, making it popular for passing the time or as a learning tool for children to develop logical thinking and strategy.</title>About the Game</li>
